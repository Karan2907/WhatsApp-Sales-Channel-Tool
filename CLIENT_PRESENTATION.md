## Client Presentation

## What We're Building

A **WhatsApp-powered sales channel** that guides your guests from first contact to post-stay engagement, all through automated messaging flows.

### The Goal
Transform WhatsApp from a simple communication tool into a **conversion-driving sales channel** that:
- Recovers abandoned bookings
- Recommends relevant accommodations
- Sends timely reservation updates
- Requests reviews and suggests complementary experiences

## How It Works - The Guest Journey

### 1. First Contact & Qualification
```
Guest → WhatsApp → Your Resort
           ↓
    "Hi [Name]! Interested in:
    • Accommodations
    • Experiences  
    • Special Offers"
```

### 2. Accommodation Recommendations
```
Based on guest interest:
• 2-3 curated suites/rooms with images
• Brief benefits for each accommodation
• "View Accommodations" button → Your booking site
```

### 3. Booking Abandonment Recovery
```
If guest adds to booking but doesn't complete:

45 minutes later → "Forgot something? 
Complete your reservation now: [Link]"

24 hours later → "Last chance! Your 
booking is about to expire"
```

### 4. Reservation Management
```
Reservation Confirmation:
"Thanks [Name]! Reservation #[ID] confirmed.
Check-in: [Date]."

Check-in Updates:
"Your stay begins tomorrow!"
```

### 5. Post-Stay Engagement
```
2-3 days after check-in:

"Enjoy your stay at [Suite Name]? 
Leave us a review!"

"Enhance your experience with our [Spa Package] 
for just $[Price]!"
```
